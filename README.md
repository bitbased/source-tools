Source Tools enhances your git workflow by providing visual indicators of changes in your code, helping you track modifications since a specific git reference point.

## Features

### ðŸ”„ Git Change Tracking

Source Tools allows you to visually track code changes against **any** git reference (branch, commit, tag) - providing more flexibility than VS Code's built-in git functionality:

- **Line-level indicators** show added, modified, and removed lines
- **File explorer badges** show new and modified files
- **Flexible base ref selection** - track against any branch, commit, or automatic detection
- **Compatible with other git tools** - uses the leftmost gutter, allowing you to see Source Tools and GitHub/GitLens indicators simultaneously

### ðŸ“‘ Quick File Access

- **Open Tracked Files** - Open all files that have been modified since your tracking base
- **Open Changed Files** - Open all files changed since the last commit

### ðŸŽ¨ Customization

- Toggle file explorer color highlighting
- Persistent settings across workspace sessions

## Usage

### Setting a Tracking Base

1. Run the command `Source Tools: Git Tracking` from the command palette
2. Select from the quick pick menu:
    - `BRANCH` - Automatically detect the branch tracking base
    - `HEAD` - Track changes since the current commit
    - A recent commit - Select from the list of recent commits
    - Custom reference - Type any valid git reference (branch name, commit hash, etc.)

### Visual Indicators

After setting a tracking base, Source Tools will display:

- **Green indicators** in the gutter for added lines
- **Blue indicators** in the gutter for modified lines
- **Red indicators** in the gutter for removed lines
- **File badges** in the explorer for added/modified files

### Quick Navigation

Access all changed files quickly:

- Run `SourceTools: Open Tracked Files` to open all files modified since your tracking base
- Run `SourceTools: Open Changed Files` to open all files modified since your last commit
